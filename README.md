# Denty-Tech-Project
#A mini Project using HTML and CSS.

📄 Description: This project is a simple webpage created using only HTML and CSS. 

🛠️ What I Built:
          •  A header with a navigation bar, complete with hover 
             effects and accessible title attributes for buttons, making 
             it 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻- 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿-𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗹𝘆.
          •  A main section that highlights creativity with tilted and styled 
              images. 
          •  A clean and professional footer with social media icons and 
              hover effects.
              
💡 Next Steps:
         •  Improve 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 for mobile and other screen sizes.
         •  Add functionality with 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁.
         •  Continue building projects to enhance my skills and deepen 
             my understanding of front-end development.
